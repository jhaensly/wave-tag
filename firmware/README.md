README
===================

WaveTag is a small, coin-cell device that allows users to "wave" short
persistence of vision messages at people.  Users can program new messages from a
smartphone over a custom visible light communication (VLC) protocol.

Dependencies
============

[AVR GNU Toolchain v3.4.3](http://www.atmel.com/tools/atmelavrtoolchainforlinux.aspx)

[AVRDUDE v6.0.1](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/)

[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)

NOTE: This has only been tested on Linux and OSX. It _should_ work on Windows as
well, though (1) it hasn't been tested and (2) there may be some issues with
path delimiters in the Makefile.

Getting started
===============

Makefile configuration
----------------------

TODO: clean this up.

Optional config.mk to override toolchain path, programmer, etc.

Using Doxygen
-------------

From the firmware directory, execute:

    $ make doc

If Doxygen is installed and on your path, it will automatically generate HTML
and LaTeX documentation in the `./doc` subdirectory.

Module details

API documentation is generated by Doxygen. See "Using doxygen" under "Getting
started" for more information.

Implementations are not documented outside the code.

For contributors
================

Coding style
------------

All firmware code should adhere to the [Linux kernel
style](http://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/) with the following
modificulations/additions:

- Indentation should be 4 columns and use spaces, not tabs.

- All conditionals should use curly braces, even those with a single clause,
  unless there is a specific reason to do otherwise.

- All public API's should include Doxygen-style comments.

- All functions and structs should be written using camelCase. With functions,
  the first word should be the name of the module. 
  
  e.g. `fooBar(...)`

- All variables should be lowercase with words separated by an underscore. 

  e.g. `my_var`

- Local variables (those decleared static within a source file) should be
  prefixed with "m\_". 
  
  e.g. `m_local_var`

- Global variables (those declared extern in a header file) should be prefixed
  with "g\_". 

  e.g. `g_global_var`

- Specific `#includes` in the header file only when required.

- System `#includes` should come before project `#includes` unless there's
  a specific reason to do otherwise.
